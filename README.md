# Unity-Course-Projects
These will be all the side projects / tutorials / prototypes I've created over the years using Unity

At the moment the main content is the Roll-A-Ball Minigame (The new tutorial using some of the new features like TMPro) I made while teaching colleagues how the engine works. 
(Tutorials) Projects created based on a tutorial with the intention to further my own personal learning or assist others with learning how the engine works.
(Prototype) Projects created based on mostly self-created assests (What is not made by me will be denoted as such in a readme inside the project and full credit will be given to the original creator.)
(Projects) These are actual Projects created with other people who are taking the unity course, mostly friends and coileagues that I will be teaching / learning with.
